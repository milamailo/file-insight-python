# FileInsight

FileInsight is a versatile file analysis tool that enables users to effortlessly calculate the sum and average of numerical data within text files, facilitating deeper insights into the underlying data trends.

## Main Features

- **Sum and Average Calculation:** Quickly calculate the sum and average of numerical data within text files.
- **Employee Average Age Calculation:** Analyze employee data to calculate the average age based on the current date.

## Usage

1. **Sum & Average:**
    - Read numerical data from a text file.
    - Calculate the sum and average of the numbers.
    - Write the results back to the file.

2. **Employee Average Age:**
    - Read employee data from a text file.
    - Parse the data into a list of dictionaries.
    - Calculate the average age of the employees based on their date of birth.
    - Display the average age.

## Function Descriptions

- **`read_write_file`:** Read from or write to a text file.
- **`convert_file_list`:** Convert a string of numbers separated by commas, dashes, or spaces into a list of integers.
- **`parse_employee_data`:** Parse employee data from a list of strings into a list of dictionaries.
- **`calculate_avg_age`:** Calculate the average age of employees based on their date of birth.
- **`sum_file`:** Calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
- **`avg_file`:** Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

## Skills Developed

- **File Handling with `open()`:** Learn how to open and manipulate files in Python using the `open()` function, gaining proficiency in reading from and writing to text files. Understanding file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, etc.) and handling file objects is essential for effective file management.

- **Data Processing Techniques:** Acquire skills in processing and manipulating text data, including splitting, parsing, and converting data into appropriate formats. Utilizing string methods (`split()`, `strip()`) and list comprehensions enables efficient data processing and extraction.

- **Regular Expression Usage:** Learn the usage of regular expressions (`re` module) for pattern matching and text manipulation tasks, allowing for flexible and powerful string processing operations. Employing regex patterns for splitting strings based on multiple delimiters enhances data parsing capabilities.

- **Working with External Libraries:** Explore the integration of external libraries and modules to extend Python's functionality. Leveraging modules like `datetime` for date and time operations, `os` for file system tasks, and `re` for regex operations broadens the scope of Python applications.

- **Data Analysis and Computation:** Develop skills in basic data analysis and computation, including calculating sums, averages, and other statistical measures from numerical data. Implementing algorithms for numerical computation and analysis enhances data analysis capabilities.

- **Problem-Solving and Algorithmic Thinking:** Enhance problem-solving abilities by breaking down tasks into smaller steps and implementing algorithms to achieve specific goals. Applying algorithmic thinking to solve problems related to data processing and analysis fosters logical and systematic problem-solving skills.
